# Final_Project
This is a readme file for my website for the Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development course.

**Project name:** Lineage Designs. Here is the link to view the webpage: http://bxion4557server.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/index.html

**Description:** This website is designed as a skeleton layout with the possibility that the owner of Lineage Designs use it as his new website. The website features products for sale. 

**Table of Contents**

To get to the specific collection you will just click on the appropriate image as indicated. That will pull up a gallery style shopping page as the rest. 
> * **About Artist** This page is as stated. History about the artist. (Needless to say)
> * **Contact** This page will contain contact information. It has an email form. It also indicates that wholesale options are available to other businesses who would like to carry the designs in their stores. Filling out the form will email the owner and commence the contact between both party.
